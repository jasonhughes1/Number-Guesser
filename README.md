# Number-Guesser



Overview

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
Phase 4 is optional. If you execute phase 4, create a separate branch in Git for that work for evaluation (using Git is an extra challenge – investigate how to initialize a Git repo and make a branch! We’ll go over how to do this in class in a few days, so this is a great time to investigate on your own).
Phase One: Basic Requirements

The application should have the following user interface components:

Zero State:

An input field for guessing the number
A button for submitting a guess
A button for clearing the input field
A button that resets the game
User’s Guess State:

Display the user’s most recent guess
Display results and feedback:
If their guess is too high, it should display: “That is too high”
If their guess is too low, it should display: “That is too low”
If the guess is correct, it should display: “BOOM!”
Some things to consider:

Input fields,regardless of their “type” attribute, store their values in strings. You’ll need to use parseInt() to turn it back into a number.
You’ll need a strategy for generating random numbers.
Phase Two: More Better

The input field should only accept numerical entries, within the defined min and max range
The application should display an error message if the guess is not a number (e.g. parseInt() returns NaN).
The application should display an error if the guess is outside of the range of possible answers.
The clear button should be disabled if there is nothing to clear.
The reset button should be disabled if there is nothing to reset.
Phase Three: Level Up

Add additional inputs that allow the user to specify the minimum/maximum range.
Upon successful win, user’s range is updated:
Every time the user wins a round increase the maximum number by 10.
Every time the user wins a round decrease the minimum number by 10.
Appropriate UI is incorporated such that user understands what is happening.
(Pro-tip: You’ll need to adjust the input fields to accept the new minimum and maximum numbers.)

Phase Four: Choose Your Own Adventure

You have liberty with the UI.

Make it two player.
Incorporate a scoring system based on how quickly user guesses correct number.
Turn it into a game to teach basic arithmetic to kids.
